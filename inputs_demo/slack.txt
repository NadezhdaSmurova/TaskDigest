Deployed hotfix for payout webhook retries (duplicate callbacks reduced). Monitoring.

    ↳ [09:14] Amir:
    👍 Thanks. Any impact on settlements?

        ↳ [09:16] Nadia:
        Should not affect existing batches. New retries only.

[09:18] Amir:
FYI KYC vendor latency is spiking (avg 8–12s). Might impact onboarding SLA today.

    ↳ [09:22] Sara:
    Seeing same from ops side. No hard failures yet.

        ↳ [09:24] Amir:
        OK, flagging as medium risk unless it degrades further.

[09:33] Amir:
Blocked: still waiting for production access to the fraud dashboard (requested yesterday).

    ↳ [09:35] Nadia:
    This blocks investigation of affiliate traffic, right?

        ↳ [09:36] Amir:
        Yes, cannot verify device fingerprints without it.

[09:41] Nadia:
Risk: new affiliate campaign traffic looks abnormal (same device fingerprint repeating).

    ↳ [09:44] Sara:
    Could be incentive abuse. Any volume spike?

        ↳ [09:47] Nadia:
        +35% vs baseline in 2 hours.

[10:08] Amir:
Question: who owns the alerting thresholds for chargeback spikes? We need a quick review.

    ↳ [10:12] Sara:
    I think Risk, but not 100% sure.

[10:20] Nadia:
Action needed: confirm if we should pause affiliate source “X-Partner” until investigation completes.

    ↳ [10:23] Amir:
    Agree — recommend temporary pause.
