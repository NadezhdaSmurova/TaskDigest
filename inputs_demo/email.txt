Subject: URGENT: Settlement mismatch in batch #2026-02-03
From: finance.ops@company.ae

Hi team,

We noticed a mismatch between the settlement report and ledger totals for batch #2026-02-03.

Difference: +18,420 AED.

Initial hypothesis: duplicated entries from a retry loop.

Can someone confirm whether the payout webhook hotfix might affect settlement records?
If we can't confirm by EOD, we may need to delay settlement to merchants.

Thanks,
Finance Ops


Subject: KYC vendor performance update
From: ops@company.ae

Hi all,

We are observing elevated response times from our KYC vendor this morning
(average latency 8–12 seconds).

No hard failures so far, but onboarding SLAs might be impacted today.
We are monitoring and will update if thresholds are crossed.

Best,
Ops Team


Subject: UI release planning – fee breakdown
From: product@company.ae

Hey team,

Based on today's risk signals, we propose moving the "fee breakdown" UI change
to the Friday release to avoid touching checkout flows today.

Please shout if there are objections.

Thanks,
Product
